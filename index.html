                <p><em>Web Developer.</em></p>
                <p>I am new to the world of Web Development, but I have had an interest in it for many years.  In high school, I took a web design class using a WYSIWYG program and took it very seriously and loved building my site.  A few years later, I took a class in web design where I had to actually type out the HTML and CSS.  Sure, it took a lot longer than dragging and dropping pictures and just creating text boxes, but I loved it.  After that life got in the way and my interest had to sit on the back burner.</p>
                <p>In 2019 I got diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.  It hit me pretty hard and left a lot of my futrure up in the air.  After coming to terms with my diagnosis, I took a look at my life.  I had a job that I wasn't happy with and a disease that could possibly take that job away from me.  I thought back to my past to figure out something I enjoyed doing that I could do for work, especially something I could do from home.  It didn't take long to rememer my interest in building web sites.  A lot had changed in the 10 years since I last tried my hand at it, so in September of 2020 I started learning how to do it again.</p></td>
